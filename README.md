Hey there! I'm Dylan, a Computer Science graduate from the University at Buffalo. I love coding, solving complex problems, and building cool projects. Right now, Iâ€™m working on expanding my portfolio of web apps and backend systems through the [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum.
